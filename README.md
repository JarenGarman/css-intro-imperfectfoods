## Set Up Instructions
1. Fork and clone this repo
2. `cd` into the directory
3. Run `open index.html` to view your app in the browser

## Instructions
### Some notes:
- The HTML is already there for you, but feel free to change that file as you wish (add elements, add IDs or classes, etc).  
- The CSS file has the font and colors listed for you. You do not need to import anything for the font, we've done that for you (HTML line 5).
- Don't worry about the worn design in the background. We will just make the background one solid color.

### Iteration 1 (after `CSS: Fundamentals` lesson):
- Do *not* worry about the layout (where elements are on the page) yet! We'll get to that after your Flexbox lesson.
- Make the text match the font and sizing from the comp
- Make the colors match the comp
- Make the image sizes match the comp
- Style the button to match the comp


### Iteration 2 (after `CSS: Flexbox` lesson):
GOAL: Use flexbox to make the layout match the comp.  

Hint: you may need to add container elements to your HTML to group the `img`, `h2`, and `p` elements that you're trying to adjust the layout of.

As a class, let's do some wireframing on the comp we're trying to match.  
What are the groupings of elements we're trying to adjust the layout of? Lets draw a box around each grouping.  
Then, we can pick one box/grouping to focus on and try to use flexbox to adjust the layout in just that box.

Ask yourself:  
Which elements are in that box?  
Do they already share a direct parent in my HTML?  Or do I need to add a container element around them in my HTML?  Lets put a visible border around that parent container to help us see it for now.  
Add flexbox to the parent and first focus on getting the children elements to be arranged in the direction you want - row or column.  Then you can try to adjust the way they're spaced within that box.  
Once you're successful aligning the layout of the elements in one box, choose another and work on that one.
